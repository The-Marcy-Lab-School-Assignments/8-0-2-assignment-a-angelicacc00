# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

The danger of making API requests from the frontend is that, the api key becomes accessible to anyone who views the source code or uses browser developer tools, malicious users can abuse the API key, leading to unauthorized access or misuse of API resources.
Making the request from the server avoids this danger because the API key is stored on the server-side, and only the server interacts with the API. The frontend communicates with the server, and the server is the middleman handling the API requests and responses. This reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access or abuse.
